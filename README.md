## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwindcss, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, 



## Optimizations
If I had more time, I would have made the textarea of the body paragraphs to include some of the styling combos-like bolding, italicize, bullet points and allow it to render it in the body paragrah of the books and blogs info. 
I would have also created a like and comment tab on the blog, just so folks can say their thoughts about the post.
